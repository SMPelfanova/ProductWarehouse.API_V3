# Phase 3

# Phase 2 + 
- **PostgreSQL Database Integration**
  - Infrastructure assembly has been changed to use PostgreSQL.
  - Implemented using a separate assembly: `ProductWarehouse.Persistence.PostgreSQL`.
  - Introduced in PR1.

- **Micro ORM Dapper Integration**
  - Started using Dapper as the micro ORM.
  - Implemented full CRUD operations for the Products domain area.
  - Implemented read-only queries for the rest of the core.
  - Introduced in PR2.

# Phase 1 + 
- **EF Core with MSSQL**
- **EF Core - Code First Approach, Fluent API, Configuration Files**
- **Repository Pattern with Generic Approach**
- **CRUD operations**

 
# Phase 1 - Product Wherehouse API
The API endpoint allows users to retrieve products and apply filters, with the ability to highlight specific keywords in product descriptions.

## Endpoint

- **GET products**
  
  When the request has no parameters.

- **GET products/filter**

  Accepts four optional query parameters to filter products or highlight words in their description:

  - `MinPrice` (decimal): Minimum price for filtering products.
  - `MaxPrice` (decimal): Maximum price for filtering products.
  - `Highlight` (string): Comma-separated list of words to highlight in product descriptions.
  - `Size` (string): Size parameter for filtering products.

  Example: `/filter?MinPrice=10&MaxPrice=89&Highlight=red,blue&Size=Medium`

## Responses

- All products if the request has no parameters.
- A filtered subset of products if the request has filter parameters.
A filter object containing:
  - Minimum and maximum price of all products in the source URL.
  - An array of all sizes of all products in the source URL.
  - An array of the ten most common words in the product descriptions, excluding the most common five.

Additionally, HTML tags are added to product descriptions to highlight the words provided in the `Highlight` parameter.
